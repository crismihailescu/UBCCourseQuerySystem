# UBC Course Query System

This project was completed as part of a semester-long course aiming to replicate industry-like development practices. 
The end result is a querying UI (see image below) that allows users to select various fields, and have the sections from courses matching those fields be returned.

The project is written in TypeScript and JavaScript. It brought in a variety of software engineering elements and challenges, including testing to the spec, creating complex recursive functions, selecting proper data structures for very specific use cases, ensuring the query engine runs within a reasonably short amount of time, transforming the results of API calls, and refactoring code to meet changing system demands, among many others. 

The entire project took around 80 hours to complete, and was broken down into four main sprints.
